Steps to install cassandra:
I) Single node cluster configuration:
	1) Create a folder like D:/cassandra
	2) Download cassandra zip file from http://cassandra.apache.org/download/ link
	3) Extract zip file under cassandra folder created in above step
	4) Go to Cassandraa extracted archive and navigate to folder named "conf"
	5) Open the file named "cassandra.yaml" in your favorite text editor.
	6) In the "Cassandra.yaml" Set the values of 
		a) data_file_directories=D:/cassandra/data folder.
		b) commitlog_directory=D:/cassandra/commitlog folder.
		c) saved_caches_directory=D:/cassandra/saved_cache folder.
		d) Edit cluster name as per our convinient otherwise by default cluster_name="Test Cluster" 
	7) Set the cassandra path as environment variable $CASSANDRA_HOME=D:/cassandra/apache-cassandra-1.2.3-bin/apache-cassandra-1.2.3
	8) Open cmd and navigate to the bin in your “Cassandra” folder and type cassandra -f as like below
		Example :D:/cassandra/apache-cassandra-1.2.3-bin/apache-cassandra-1.2.3\bin>cassandra -f
	9) Now your cassandra server have started to work on your localhost with portno 9160.
	
II) Multiple nodes cluster configuration:
	1) Create a folder D:/cassandra
	2) Download cassandra zip file from http://cassandra.apache.org/download/ link
	3) Extract zip file under cassandra
	4) Go to Cassandraa extracted archive and navigate to folder named “conf”
	5) Open the file named “cassandra.yaml” in your favorite text editor.
	6) Modify following details as per our convienent in cassandra.yaml file in Machine A 
		cluster_name: "MyclusterName"
		listen_address: 192.168.2.17(Machine A address)
		rpc_address: 0.0.0.0   
		- seeds: "192.168.2.17" (For the nodes understand each other)
	7) Modify following details as per our convienent in cassandra.yaml file in Machine B
		cluster_name: "MyclusterName"
		listen_address: 192.168.2.186(Machine B address)
		rpc_address: 0.0.0.0   
		- seeds: "192.168.2.17"
	8) Use following command to test above two nodes are in a cluster i.e "MyclusterName"
		$CASSANDRA_HOME/bin>nodetool ring
		
Note: 1) Restart server once we done modification in cassandra.yaml.
      2) Use system ip address if we connected multiple nodes cluster
